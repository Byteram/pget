DESCRIPTION_DETAILED: |
  pget is a cross-platform, Python-native package manager for userland CLI apps on Linux and macOS.
  It installs applications to ~/.pget/bin/ and makes them available as executable commands.
  
  Applications are downloaded from GitHub repositories under the pynosaur organization.
  Each application must have an 'app' directory with a main.py file or a single main.py file.
  
  The package manager supports both single-file applications (just main.py) and multi-file
  applications (app directory with multiple files).
